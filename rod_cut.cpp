//Here, the rod must be cut so as to have minimum cost
// There is a rod of length N lying on x-axis with its left end at x = 0 and right end at
//  x = N. Now, there are M weak points on this rod denoted by 
//  positive integer values(all less than N) A1, A2, â€¦, AM. You have to cut rod at all 
//  these weak points. You can perform these cuts in any order. After a cut, rod gets 
//  divided into two smaller sub-rods. Cost of making a cut is the length of the sub-rod 
//  in which you are making a cut.

// Your aim is to minimise this cost.
// Return an array denoting the sequence in which you will make cuts. 
// If two different sequences of cuts give same cost, return the lexicographically smallest.
